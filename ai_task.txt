System Overview for GOAL Project Management:
Files & Directories:
ai_agent_requirements.txt:

A summary of all requirements and details for future reference.
goals.xml:

Stores major projects and their details.
ai_tasks.xml:

Contains individual tasks for the AI to perform, generated from the goals.
questions.xml:

Holds questions queued for you, to be interacted with via turk.py.
turk.xml:

Contains Mechanical Turk actions or tasks that a human must perform.
ai_error.xml:

Logs errors with timestamps for review and resolution.
q_and_a.xml:

Stores previously asked and answered questions to avoid repetition.
metrics.xml:

Contains data for post-project analysis and AI self-improvement.
Directories for Each GOAL:

Each GOAL will have its own directory to manage related tasks, questions, and other relevant data.
Scripts:
main.py:

Runs in a loop, executing AI tasks from ai_tasks.xml.
Checks for dependencies and prerequisites before executing tasks.
Generates questions and Turk tasks as needed, placing them in questions.xml and turk.xml respectively.
Updates ai_error.xml and metrics.xml as needed.
turk.py:

Interactive script that communicates with you.
Presents questions from questions.xml and tasks from turk.xml.
Allows you to provide feedback and instructions in a free-form, conversational manner.
Facilitates review and approval of AI-generated content and task outcomes.
Enables you to modify and prioritize tasks and goals interactively.
update.py:

Manages updates to main.py and turk.py as needed by the system.
Maintains versioning of scripts and facilitates review and confirmation of new versions.
Workflow:
AI Workflow:

Continuously works through tasks in ai_tasks.xml using main.py.
Generates questions and Turk tasks as needed during processing.
Updates error logs and metrics during operation.
Human Interaction (via turk.py):

Interact to review and answer questions, provide feedback, and perform Turk tasks.
Review and approve AI-generated content and task outcomes.
Modify and prioritize tasks and goals interactively.
Script Updating (via update.py):

Updates scripts as needed, maintaining versioning.
Facilitates review and confirmation of new script versions via Turk tasks and questions.
Feedback Mechanism:

Allows you to provide feedback on task outcomes and AI-generated content.
AI utilizes feedback for continuous improvement.
Review and Approval:

AI-generated content and task outcomes are reviewed and approved interactively.
Ensures quality and accuracy in outputs and subsequent tasks.
Metrics & Improvement:
The AI will track various metrics, such as task completion time, error rates, and feedback, to facilitate continuous improvement and provide insights during post-project analysis.
